// Two-pass capture: find the disc, then re-crop straight from the source so
// the disc fills the size the thresholds were tuned at, then measure that.
//
// Why: the pore thresholds (black-hat kernel, porosity cuts) were tuned with
// the disc filling a 260px circle in the 300x300 canvas. A loose calibration
// ring works fine for *finding* the disc but leaves it smaller in the canvas,
// so the measurement would depend on how big the user drew the ring. Pass 1
// uses the calibrated region only to locate the disc; pass 2 re-renders from
// the full-resolution source with that disc centered at the design size, so
// the ring size and placement no longer matter. (Tested on 44 full-frame
// stand-ins: this reproduces the tight-ring measurements at ring sizes
// 1.3x-1.8x. It does not by itself change grading accuracy -- an earlier note
// here claiming loose rings read ~0.7x lower came from a flawed simulation.)
